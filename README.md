# Pytorch Learning
Pytorch algorithms on Mnist Fashion dataset  

CNN : Convolutional neural network  
LeNet : Convolutional neural network with different approch (mostly known as the neural network for image classification)  
MLP : Multilayer perceptron (Only linear layers)  
  
Replace the 'np.load("PATH")' with your actual data  
You can tweak the hyperparameters as you want, and also the layers' parameters
